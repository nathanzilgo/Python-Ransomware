Simple Python Ransomware with Crypter and Decrypter scripts

Not ready for usage yet. Missing decrypter.

I don't recommend using it without caution, this is an academic learning tool, I can't be held responsible for the misuse of this tool by other users.

Don't run this on your personal or work machine, if you want to try the runtime, try it on a Virtual Machine or controlled environment.
